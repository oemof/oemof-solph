On this page we collect showcases applications using or emplyoing oemof.solph.
These tools are working in a stable state and should be usable from scratch.
Furthermore, in our blog on oemof.org, we sometimes post examples implemented
`by the community <https://oemof.org/category/showcase/>`__.

If you want to add your example here, please open an issue on GitHub and let us
know. The application should be in a stable state and the source code should be
accessible freely, so other users can explore and learn from your project.
