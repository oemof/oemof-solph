v0.5.4 (August 19th, 2024)
--------------------------

New features
############

* Explicitly allow to have multiple inputs or outputs for Sinks and Sources,
  respectively.
* Allow to set lower limits for generic_integral_limit constraint.


Documentation
#############

* Improve documentation of full load time.

Other changes
#############

* Refined internal sequence generation. (For e.g. constraint formulations,
  Scalars are internally mapped to fake sequences without a defined length.)

Known issues
############

* Incompatible to numpy >= 2.0.0. This is because of Pyomo, but we have to
  enforce a lower version in our package.

Contributors

* Patrik Sch√∂nfeldt
