v0.4.0 (April ??, 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++


API changes
###########

* The attribute `capacity` of the `GenericStorage` describing the current
  absolute stored energy/material/water etc. has been renamed to `storage_content`.
  In the `GenericStorageBlock` and `GenericInvestmentStorageBlock`,
  the attribute `init_cap` has been renamed `init_content`. This change is
  intended to avoid confusion with `nominal_storage_capacity` or capacity in terms
  of installed capacity.
* Allow to limit count of concurrently active flows in group of flows.
  (Flows have to be NonConvex, the limit can be an upper or lower one.)

New features
############

* Allows having a non equidistant timeindex. By adding the
    calculate_timeincrement function to tools/helpers.py a non
    equidistant timeincrement can be calculated. The EnergySystem
    will now be defined by the timeindex and the calculated
    timeincrement.

* Allows non-convex investments for flows and storages.
    With this feature, fix investment costs, which do not dependent on the
    nominal capacity, can be considered.

* The ``loss_rate`` of `~oemof.solph.components.GenericStorage`
    is now defined per time increment.
* The parameters' data type in the docstrings is changed from
  `numeric (sequence or scalar)` to `numeric (iterable or scalar)`
  (`Issue #673 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph/issues/673>`_).
