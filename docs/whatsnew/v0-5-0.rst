v0.5.0
------


API changes
###########

* Parts of the energy system graph are now clearly structured into `buses`, `components`, and `flows`.
* Public and private API are be more distinguished now. ('_' signifies private, public API is defined in init files.)
* Experimental code is now sitting in submodules called `experimental` (replaces "custom").
* The flow arguments `summed_min`and `summed_max` now have the more descriptive names `full_load_time_min` and `full_load_time_max`.
* Keyword arguments are now explicit. This will i.e. catch typos. Custom attributes can be added using the argument `custom_attributes`.


New features
############

* Add `inactivity_costs` as an option for `Flow`s.
* Add `InvestNonConvexFlowBlock` which provides the possibility to perform capacity optimization of assets considering their min/max loads, as well as their operation status.
