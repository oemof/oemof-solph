* Parts of the energy system graph are now clearly structured into `buses`, `components`, and `flows`.
* Public and private API are be more distinguished now. ('_' signifies private, public API is defined in init files.)
* Started API for distinct `Flow`, `InvestmentFlow`, `NonConvexFlow`, and `NonConvexInvestmentFlow`.
* Experimental code is now sitting in submodules called `experimental` (replaces "custom").
* The flow arguments `summed_min`and `summed_max` now have the more descriptive names `full_load_time_min` and `full_load_time_max`.


New features

* Add `inactivity_costs` as an option for `NonConvexFlow`.
* Add `NonConvexInvestmentFlow` which provides the possibility to perform capacity optimization of assets considering their min/max loads, as well as their operation status.
