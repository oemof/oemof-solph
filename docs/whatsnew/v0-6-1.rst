API changes
###########


New features
############
* GenericStorage requires explicitly set `Investment` objects if the `invest_relation` 
  keywords are used. Automatic creation of the `Investment` objects is removed.
* Two new keys added to `Results` class (experimental) to calculate variable costs and 
  investment costs via `results["variable_costs"]` and `results["investment_costs"]`.

Documentation

Bug fixes
#########
* Setting `invest_relation_input_output` now actually creates the relational 
  constraint.

Other changes
#############

* Implement a backward-compatibility module for processing.results that uses
  the new solph.Results object.
* Experimental component `SinkDSM` (unmaintained) has been removed
* Unmaintained, non-working functionality for three-phase electricity has been
  removed.

Known issues
############

* Backward-compatibile result extraction (processing.results)
  of mutli-period-models fails.
