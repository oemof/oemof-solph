API changes
###########

* Costs for energy storage are now defined for N-1 points in time
  (initial time step is neglected). This is because with a balanced
  storage, content of the initial and the first time step (which is
  effectively the same) had double weight before. Also, if the
  initial storage level is defined, the costs just offset the
  objective value without changing anything else.
* Tansitional wrappers that still allowed to use "Transformer" and
  "OffsetTransformer" have been removed. Use of the new names
  ("Converter" and "OffsetConverter") is now obligatory.
* Tansitional wrappers that still allowed to use "investment",
  "summed_min", and "summed_max" as arguments to initialise a Flow
  have been removed. Use of the new names ("nominal_value",
  "full_load_time_min", and "full_load_time_max") is now obligatory.
* Rename custom_attributes to custom_properties for all Nodes.
  Setting the oemof.network.Node.custom_properties
  using an argument called "custom_attributes" was rather confusing.
  Additionally, the class Bus already called the argument
  "custom_properties".
* The parameters `GenericStorage.nominal_storage_capacity` and
  `Flow.nominal_value` are now both called `nominal_capacity`.

* `Model.solve()` will now fail, if solver status is nonoptimal. 
  Added new keyword `allow_nonoptimal` to deactivate this behaviour.
