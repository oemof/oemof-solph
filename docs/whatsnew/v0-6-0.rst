v0.6.0 (????)

API changes
###########

* New attribute `tsa_paramters` of `oemof.solph.EnergySystem`

New features
############

* Allow usage of aggregated timeseries by
  [TSAM](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam) module. Original timeseries is
  reflected by weighting typical periods (output from TSAM) accordingly.
  Thus, variable costs, full load hours, startup/shutdown costs are weighted
  accordingly to occurrences of typical period in original timeseries.
  Additionally, storage equations are adapted in order to respect
  long-term/saisonal energy storage.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix objective weighting for startup and shutdown costs in case of no
  multi-period approach.

Testing
#######

* Added test for comparison of TSAM mode versus original mode.
  Including testing of storage behaviour, variable and investment costs.
