* Costs for energy storage are now defined for N-1 points in time
  (initial time step is neglected). This is because with a balanced
  storage, content of the initial and the first time step (which is
  effectively the same) had double weight before. Also, if the
  initial storage level is defined, the costs just offset the
  objective value without changing anything else.
* The parameters `GenericStorage.nominal_storage_capacity` and
  `Flow.nominal_value` are now both called `nominal_capacity`.
