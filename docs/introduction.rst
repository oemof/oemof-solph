Introduction
============
`oemof.solph` is a model generator for energy system modelling and Optimisation
(LP/MILP). The oemof.solph package is part of the
`open energy modelling framework (oemof) <https://github.com/oemof/oemof>`_.
This is an organisational framework to bundle tools for energy (system) modelling.
oemof-solph is a model generator for energy system modelling and optimisation.

The package ``oemof.solph`` is very often called just ``oemof``.
This is because installing the ``oemof`` meta package was once the best way to get ``oemof.solph``.
Notice that you should prefeably install ``oemof.solph`` instead of ``oemof``
if you want to use ``solph``.

Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop oemof.solph.
Read our `contribution <https://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ section.

Contribution is already possible on a low level by simply fixing typos in
oemof's documentation or rephrasing sections which are unclear.
If you want to support us that way please fork the oemof-solph repository to your own
GitHub account and make changes as described in the `github guidelines <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world>`_

If you have questions regarding the use of oemof including oemof.solph you can visit the openmod forum (`tag oemof <https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/tags/c/qa/oemof>`_ or `tag oemof-solph <https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/tags/c/qa/oemof-solph>`_) and open a new thread if your questions hasn't been already answered.

Keep in touch! - You can become a watcher at our `github site <https://github.com/oemof/oemof>`_,
but this will bring you quite a few mails and might be more interesting for developers.
If you just want to get the latest news, like when is the next oemof meeting,
you can follow our news-blog at `oemof.org <https://oemof.org/>`_.
