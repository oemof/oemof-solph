        The constraint tests uncovered a spurious error where the flows of an
        investment `Sink` where not put into the `InvestmentFlow` group,
        although the corresponding grouping was present in the energy system.
        The error occured in the case where the investment `Sink` was not
        instantiated directly after the `Bus` it is connected to.

        This test recreates this error scenario and makes sure that the
        `InvestmentFlow` group is not empty.
