class Investment:
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    maximum : float, :math:`P_{invest,max}` or :math:`E_{invest,max}`
        Maximum of the additional invested capacity
    minimum : float, :math:`P_{invest,min}` or :math:`E_{invest,min}`
        Minimum of the additional invested capacity. If `nonconvex` is `True`,
        `minimum` defines the threshold for the invested capacity.
    ep_costs : float, :math:`c_{invest,var}`
        Equivalent periodical costs for the investment per flow capacity.
    existing : float, :math:`P_{exist}` or :math:`E_{exist}`
        Existing / installed capacity. The invested capacity is added on top
        of this value. Not applicable if `nonconvex` is set to `True`.
    nonconvex : bool
        If `True`, a binary variable for the status of the investment is
        created. This enables additional fix investment costs (*offset*)
        independent of the invested flow capacity. Therefore, use the `offset`
        parameter.
    offset : float, :math:`c_{invest,fix}`
        Additional fix investment costs. Only applicable if `nonconvex` is set
        to `True`.
    overall_maximum : float
        Overall maximum capacity investment, i.e. the amount of capacity
        that can be totally installed at maximum in any period (taking into
        account decommissionings); only applicable for multi-period models
    overall_minimum : float
        Overall minimum capacity investment that needs to be installed
        in the last period of the simulation (taking into account
        decommissionings); only applicable for multi-period models
    lifetime : int
        Units lifetime, given in years; only applicable for multi-period
        models
    age : int
        Units start age, given in years at the beginning of the simulation;
        only applicable for multi-period models
    interest_rate : float
        Interest rate for calculating annuities when investing in that unit;
        only applicable for multi-period models
    fixed_costs : float or list of float
        Fixed costs in each period; only applicable for multi-period models


    For the variables, constraints and parts of the objective function, which
    are created, see :class:`oemof.solph.blocks.investment_flow.InvestmentFlowBlock`
    and :class:`oemof.solph.components._generic_storage.GenericInvestmentStorageBlock`.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Costs associated with a start of the flow (representing a unit).
    shutdown_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        Costs associated with the shutdown of the flow (representing a unit).
    activity_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        Costs associated with the active operation of the flow, independently
        from the actual output.
    inactivity_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        Costs associated with not operating the flow.
    minimum_uptime : numeric (1 or positive integer)
        Minimum time that a flow must be greater then its minimum flow after
        startup. Be aware that minimum up and downtimes can contradict each
        other and may lead to infeasible problems.
    minimum_downtime : numeric (1 or positive integer)
        Minimum time a flow is forced to zero after shutting down.
        Be aware that minimum up and downtimes can contradict each
        other and may to infeasible problems.
    maximum_startups : numeric (0 or positive integer)
        Maximum number of start-ups.
    maximum_shutdowns : numeric (0 or positive integer)
        Maximum number of shutdowns.
    initial_status : numeric (0 or 1)
        Integer value indicating the status of the flow in the first time step
        (0 = off, 1 = on). For minimum up and downtimes, the initial status
        is set for the respective values in the edge regions e.g. if a
        minimum uptime of four timesteps is defined, the initial status is
        fixed for the four first and last timesteps of the optimization period.
        If both, up and downtimes are defined, the initial status is set for
        the maximum of both e.g. for six timesteps if a minimum downtime of
        six timesteps is defined in addition to a four timestep minimum uptime.
    positive_gradient : :obj:`dict`, default: `{'ub': None, 'costs': 0}`
        A dictionary containing the following two keys:
