class Investment:
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    maximum : float, :math:`P_{invest,max}` or :math:`E_{invest,max}`
        Maximum of the additional invested capacity
    minimum : float, :math:`P_{invest,min}` or :math:`E_{invest,min}`
        Minimum of the additional invested capacity. If `nonconvex` is `True`,
        `minimum` defines the threshold for the invested capacity.
    ep_costs : float, :math:`c_{invest,var}`
        Equivalent periodical costs for the investment per flow capacity.
    existing : float, :math:`P_{exist}` or :math:`E_{exist}`
        Existing / installed capacity. The invested capacity is added on top
        of this value. Not applicable if `nonconvex` is set to `True`.
    nonconvex : bool
        If `True`, a binary variable for the status of the investment is
        created. This enables additional fix investment costs (*offset*)
        independent of the invested flow capacity. Therefore, use the `offset`
        parameter.
    offset : float, :math:`c_{invest,fix}`
        Additional fix investment costs. Only applicable if `nonconvex` is set
        to `True`.


    For the variables, constraints and parts of the objective function, which
    are created, see :class:`oemof.solph.blocks.InvestmentFlow` and
    :class:`oemof.solph.components.GenericInvestmentStorageBlock`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    startup_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        Costs associated with a start of the flow (representing a unit).

        Costs associated with the shutdown of the flow (representing a unit).
    activity_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        Costs associated with the active operation of the flow, independently
        from the actual output.
    minimum_uptime : numeric (1 or positive integer)
        Minimum time that a flow must be greater then its minimum flow after
        startup. Be aware that minimum up and downtimes can contradict each
        other and may lead to infeasible problems.
    minimum_downtime : numeric (1 or positive integer)
        Minimum time a flow is forced to zero after shutting down.
        Be aware that minimum up and downtimes can contradict each
        other and may to infeasible problems.
    maximum_startups : numeric (0 or positive integer)
        Maximum number of start-ups.
    maximum_shutdowns : numeric (0 or positive integer)
        Maximum number of shutdowns.
    initial_status : numeric (0 or 1)

        fixed for the four first and last timesteps of the optimization period.
        If both, up and downtimes are defined, the initial status is set for
        the maximum of both e.g. for six timesteps if a minimum downtime of
        six timesteps is defined in addition to a four timestep minimum uptime.
