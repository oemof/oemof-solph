class Investment:

    Parameters
    ----------
    maximum : float, :math:`P_{invest,max}` or :math:`E_{invest,max}`
        Maximum of the additional invested capacity
    minimum : float, :math:`P_{invest,min}` or :math:`E_{invest,min}`
        Minimum of the additional invested capacity. If `nonconvex` is `True`,
        `minimum` defines the threshold for the invested capacity.
    ep_costs : float, :math:`c_{invest,var}`
        Equivalent periodical costs for the investment per flow capacity.
    existing : float, :math:`P_{exist}` or :math:`E_{exist}`
        Existing / installed capacity. The invested capacity is added on top
        of this value. Not applicable if `nonconvex` is set to `True`.
    nonconvex : bool
        If `True`, a binary variable for the status of the investment is
        created. This enables additional fix investment costs (*offset*)
        independent of the invested flow capacity. Therefore, use the `offset`
        parameter.
    offset : float, :math:`c_{invest,fix}`
        Additional fix investment costs. Only applicable if `nonconvex` is set
        to `True`.

    are created, see :class:`oemof.solph.blocks.investment_flow.InvestmentFlow`

    ep_costs : sequence of float, :math:`c_{invest}(p)`
        Equivalent periodical costs for the investment per flow capacity.
        Values may differ on a periodical basis and have to be given as

        itself.
    existing : float, :math:`P_{exist}` or :math:`E_{exist}`
        Existing / installed capacity. The invested capacity is added on top
        of this value. Not applicable if `nonconvex` is set to `True`. Existing
        capacity will be decommissioned when its lifetime is reached, in turn
        accounting for a start age.
    nonconvex : bool
        If `True`, a binary variable for the status of the investment is
        created. This enables additional fix investment costs (*offset*)
        independent of the invested flow capacity. Therefore, use the `offset`
        parameter.
    offset : float, :math:`c_{invest,fix}(p)`
        Additional fix investment costs. Only applicable if `nonconvex` is set
        to `True`. Values may vary on a periodical basis.
    overall_maximum : float, :math:`P_{overall_max}`
        Overall amount of capacity that may not be exceeded by the total
        installed capacity in every period. Note: Decommissionings due to unit
        age are taken into account.
    overall_minimum : float, :math:`P_{overall_min}`
        An overall limit for the capacity to be installed in the last period
        of the optimization timeframe
    lifetime : int, :math:`lifetime`
        The lifetime of a certain technology given in the number of periods
        from investment to decommissioning
    age : int, :math:`age`
        The start age of a technology for period 0. To be used in combination
        with :attr:`existing` > 0.
    interest_rate : float
        The interest rate for calculating an annuity (can either be set from
        an microeconomic point of view, where it equals the interest an
        investor wishes to earn, or from a social planner point of view,
        where it equals the inflation rate used for discounting
        nominal payments)
    fixed_costs : sequence of float, :math:`c_{fixed}(p)`
        Fixed costs for the investment per flow capacity.
        Values may differ on a periodical basis and have to be given as
        nominal values. Values are discounted by the model itself.

        Minimum time that a flow must be greater then its minimum flow after
        startup. Be aware that minimum up and downtimes can contradict each
        other and may lead to infeasible problems.
    minimum_downtime : numeric (1 or positive integer)
