class Flow(Edge):
    r"""Defines a flow between two nodes.

    Keyword arguments are used to set the attributes of this flow. Parameters
    which are handled specially are noted below.
    For the case where a parameter can be either a scalar or an iterable, a
    scalar value will be converted to a sequence containing the scalar value at
    every index. This sequence is then stored under the parameter's key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nominal_capacity : numeric, :math:`P_{nom}` or
            :class:`Investment <oemof.solph.options.Investment>`
        The nominal calacity of the flow, either fixed or as an investement
        optimisation. If this value is set, the corresponding optimization
        variable of the flow object will be bounded by this value
        multiplied by min(lower bound)/max(upper bound).
    variable_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar), default: 0, :math:`c`
        The costs associated with one unit of the flow per hour. The
        costs for each timestep (:math:`P_t \cdot c \cdot \delta(t)`)
        will be added to the objective expression of the optimization problem.
    max : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{max}`
        Normed maximum value of the flow. The flow absolute maximum will be
        calculated by multiplying :attr:`nominal_capacity` with :attr:`max`
    min : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{min}`
        Normed minimum value of the flow (see :attr:`max`).
    fix : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{fix}`
        Normed fixed value for the flow variable. Will be multiplied with the
        :attr:`nominal_capacity` to get the absolute value.
    positive_gradient_limit : numeric (iterable, scalar or None)
        the normed *upper bound* on the positive difference
        (`flow[t-1] < flow[t]`) of two consecutive flow values.
    negative_gradient_limit : numeric (iterable, scalar or None)
            the normed *upper bound* on the negative difference
            (`flow[t-1] > flow[t]`) of two consecutive flow values.
    full_load_time_max : numeric, :math:`t_{full\_load,max}`
        Maximum energy transported by the flow expressed as the time (in
        hours) that the flow would have to run at nominal capacity
        (`nominal_capacity`).
    full_load_time_min : numeric, :math:`t_{full\_load,min}`
        Minimum energy transported by the flow expressed as the time (in
        hours) that the flow would have to run at nominal capacity
        (`nominal_capacity`).
    integer : boolean
        Set True to bound the flow values to integers.
    nonconvex : :class:`NonConvex <oemof.solph.options.NonConvex>`
        If a nonconvex flow object is added here, the flow constraints will
        be altered significantly as the mathematical model for the flow
        will be different, i.e. constraint etc. from
        :class:`~oemof.solph.flows._non_convex_flow_block.NonConvexFlowBlock`
        will be used instead of
        :class:`~oemof.solph.flows._simple_flow_block.SimpleFlowBlock`.
    fixed_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`c_{fixed}`
        The fixed costs associated with a flow.
        Note: These are only applicable for a multi-period model
        and given on a yearly basis.
    lifetime : int, :math:`l`
        The lifetime of a flow (usually given in years);
        once it reaches its lifetime (considering also
        an initial age), the flow is forced to 0.
        Note: Only applicable for a multi-period model.
    age : int, :math:`a`
        The initial age of a flow (usually given in years);
        once it reaches its lifetime (considering also
        an initial age), the flow is forced to 0.
        Note: Only applicable for a multi-period model.

    Notes
    -----
    See :py:class:`~oemof.solph.flows._simple_flow.SimpleFlowBlock`
    for the variables, constraints and objective parts, that are created for
    a Flow object.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a fixed flow object:

    >>> f = Flow(nominal_capacity=2, fix=[10, 4, 4], variable_costs=5)
    >>> f.variable_costs[2]
    5
    >>> f.fix[2]
    np.int64(4)

    Creating a flow object with time-depended lower and upper bounds:

    >>> f1 = Flow(min=[0.2, 0.3], max=0.99, nominal_capacity=100)
    >>> f1.max[1]
    0.99
