    Demand Side Management implemented as a Sink with flexibility potential
    to deviate from the baseline demand in upwards or downwards direction.

    There are several approaches possible which can be selected:

    * DIW: Based on the paper by Zerrahn, Alexander and Schill, Wolf-Peter
      (2015): `On the representation of demand-side management in power system
      models, in: Energy (84), pp. 840-845,
      10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.037
      <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.037>`_,
      accessed 08.01.2021, pp. 842-843.
    * DLR: Based on the PhD thesis of Gils, Hans Christian (2015):
      `Balancing of Intermittent Renewable Power Generation by Demand Response
      and Thermal Energy Storage`, Stuttgart,
      `<http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-6888>`_,
      accessed 08.01.2021, pp. 67-70.
    * oemof: Created by Julian Endres. A fairly simple DSM representation which
      demands the energy balance to be levelled out in fixed cycles

    An evaluation of different modeling approaches has been carried out and
    presented at the INREC 2020. Some of the results are as follows:

    * DIW: A solid implementation with the tendency of slight overestimization
      of potentials since a `shift_time` is not included. It may get
      computationally expensive due to a high time-interlinkage in constraint
      formulations.
    * DLR: An extensive modeling approach for demand response which neither
      leads to an over- nor underestimization of potentials and balances
      modeling detail and computation intensity. `fixes` and
      `addition` should both be set to True which is the default value.
    * oemof: A very computationally efficient approach which only requires the
      energy balance to be levelled out in certain intervals. If demand
      response is not at the center of the research and/or parameter
      availability is limited, this approach should be chosen.
      Note that approach `oemof` does allow for load shedding,
      but does not impose a limit on maximum amount of shedded energy.

    SinkDSM adds additional constraints that allow to shift energy in certain
    time window constrained by :attr:`~capacity_up` and
    :attr:`~capacity_down`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    demand: numeric
        original electrical demand (normalized)
        For investment modeling, it is advised to use the maximum of the
        demand timeseries and the cumulated (fixed) infeed time series
        for normalization, because the balancing potential may be determined by
        both. Elsewhise, underinvestments may occur.
    capacity_up: int or array
        maximum DSM capacity that may be increased (normalized)
    capacity_down: int or array
        maximum DSM capacity that may be reduced (normalized)
    approach: str, one of 'oemof', 'DIW', 'DLR'
        Choose one of the DSM modeling approaches. Read notes about which
        parameters to be applied for which approach.

        oemof :

            Simple model in which the load shift must be compensated in a
            predefined fixed interval (:attr:`~shift_interval` is mandatory).
            Within time windows of the length :attr:`~shift_interval` DSM
            up and down shifts are balanced. See
            :class:`~SinkDSMOemofBlock` for details.

        DIW :

            Sophisticated model based on the formulation by
            Zerrahn & Schill (2015a). The load shift of the component must be
            compensated in a predefined delay time (:attr:`~delay_time` is

    Note
    ----

    * :attr:`method` has been renamed to :attr:`approach`.
    * As many constraints and dependencies are created in approach 'DIW',
      computational cost might be high with a large 'delay_time' and with model
      of high temporal resolution
    * The approach 'DLR' preforms better in terms of calculation time,
      compared to the approach 'DIW'
    * Using :attr:`~approach` 'DIW' or 'DLR' might result in demand shifts that
      exceed the specified delay time by activating up and down simultaneously
      in the time steps between to DSM events. Thus, the purpose of this
      component is to model demand response portfolios rather than individual
      demand units.
    * It's not recommended to assign cost to the flow that connects
      :class:`~SinkDSM` with a bus. Instead, use :attr:`~SinkDSM.cost_dsm_up`
      or :attr:`~cost_dsm_down_shift`
    * Variable costs may be attributed to upshifts, downshifts or both.
      Costs for shedding may deviate from that for shifting
      (usually costs for shedding are much larger and equal to the value
      of lost load).

    *Note*: For the sake of readability, the handling of indices is not
    displayed here. E.g. evaluating a variable for t-L may lead to a negative
    and therefore infeasible index.
    This is addressed by limiting the sums to non-negative indices within the
    model index bounds. Please refer to the constraints implementation
    themselves.

    *Note*: For the sake of readability, the handling of indices is not
    displayed here. E.g. evaluating a variable for t-L may lead to a negative
    and therefore infeasible index.
    This is addressed by limiting the sums to non-negative indices within the
    model index bounds. Please refer to the constraints implementation
    themselves.

    *Note*: For the sake of readability, the handling of indices is not
    displayed here. E.g. evaluating a variable for t-L may lead to a negative
    and therefore infeasible index.
    This is addressed by limiting the sums to non-negative indices within the
    model index bounds. Please refer to the constraints implementation
    themselves.

    *Note*: For the sake of readability, the handling of indices is not
    displayed here. E.g. evaluating a variable for t-L may lead to a negative
    and therefore infeasible index.
    This is addressed by limiting the sums to non-negative indices within the
    model index bounds. Please refer to the constraints implementation
    themselves.

    **The following parts of the objective function are created:**

    * Investment annuity:
