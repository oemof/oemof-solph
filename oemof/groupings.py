class Grouping:
    """
    Used to aggregate :class:`entities <oemof.core.network.Entity>` in an
    :class:`energy system <oemof.core.energy_system.EnergySystem>` into
    :attr:`groups <oemof.core.energy_system.EnergySystem.groups>`.

    The way :class:`Groupings <Grouping>` work is that each :class:`Grouping`
    :obj:`g` of an energy system is called whenever an :class:`entity
    <oemof.core.network.Entity>` is added to the energy system (and for each
    :class:`entity <oemof.core.network.Entity>` already present, if the energy
    system is created with existing enties).
    The call :obj:`g(e, groups)`, where :obj:`e` is an :class:`entity
    <oemof.core.network.Entity>` and :attr:`groups
    <oemof.core.energy_system.EnergySystem.groups>` is a dictionary mapping
    group keys to groups, then uses the three functions :meth:`key
    <Grouping.key>`, :meth:`value <Grouping.value>` and :meth:`merge
    <Grouping.merge>` in the following way:

        - :meth:`key(e) <Grouping.key>` is called to obtain a key :obj:`k`
          under which the group should be stored,
        - :meth:`value(e) <Grouping.value>` is called to obtain a value
          :obj:`v` (the actual group) to store under :obj:`k`,
        - if you supplied a :func:`filter` argument, :obj:`v` is
          :func:`filtered <builtins.filter>` using that function,
        - otherwise, if there is not yet anything stored under
          :obj:`groups[k]`, :obj:`groups[k]` is set to :obj:`v`. Otherwise
          :meth:`merge <Grouping.merge>` is used to figure out how to merge
          :obj:`v` into the old value of :obj:`groups[k]`, i.e.
          :obj:`groups[k]` is set to :meth:`merge(v, groups[k])
          <Grouping.merge>`.

    Instead of trying to use this class directly, have a look at its
    subclasses, like :class:`Nodes`, which should cater for most use cases.

    Notes
    -----

    When overriding methods using any of the constructor parameters, you don't
    have access to :obj:`self` in the corresponding function. If you need
    access to :obj:`self`, subclass :class:`Grouping` and override the methods
    in the subclass.

    A :class:`Grouping` may be called more than once on the same object
    :obj:`e`, so one should make sure that user defined :class:`Grouping`
    :obj:`g` is idempotent, i.e. :obj:`g(e, g(e, d)) == g(e, d)`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    key: callable or hashable

        Specifies (if not callable) or extracts (if callable) a :meth:`key
        <Grouping.key>` for each :class:`entity <oemof.core.network.Entity>` of
        the :class:`energy system <oemof.core.energy_system.EnergySystem>`.

    constant_key: hashable (optional)

        Specifies a constant :meth:`key <Grouping.key>`. Keys specified using
        this parameter are not called but taken as is.

    value: callable, optional

        Overrides the default behaviour of :meth:`value <Grouping.value>`.

    filter: callable, optional

        If supplied, whatever is returned by :meth:`value` is :func:`filtered
        <builtins.filter>` through this. Mostly useful in conjunction with
        static (i.e. non-callable) :meth:`keys <key>`.
        See :meth:`filter` for more details.

    merge: callable, optional

        Overrides the default behaviour of :meth:`merge <Grouping.merge>`.
