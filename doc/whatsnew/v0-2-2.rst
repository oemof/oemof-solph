New features
############
* We added a new attribute `existing` to the `solph.options.Investement` class.
  It will now be possible to run investment optimization based on already
  installed capacity of a component. (`Issue #489 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/489>`_).
  Take a look on :ref:`investment_mode_label` for usage of this option.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for
  one object. If more than one object was present the input/output constraint
  was missing. This leads to wrong results.
* In the solph constraints module the emission constraint did not include
  the timeincrement form the model which has now be fixed.
